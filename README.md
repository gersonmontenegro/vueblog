Blog made in Vue.js

This time, I'm gonna make something new: A Front end for a kinda of blog made entirely in Vue.js.

Like in my previous personal projects, I'm gonna plan a little bit about it, so, this process will have:

 1. The basic idea.
 2. App structure.
 3. App scheme.
 4. Mockups - Design.
 5. Some informal EDT.

Then, I'll start to code.

1. The basic idea

I need a web application where the users can read posts, and an admin to be able to login, create, update, and delete posts.

Sounds simple, but it doesn't, because if I want to make something with a minimum of quality, it required a lot of work, details, time, etc.

2. App structure

As simple as possible, at least right now with the main idea. If there is more time for more, will be ok.

3. App scheme

4. Mockups - Designs.
Yes, usually those titles are in separate states, but this time I should di it this way because the time.

I draw some idea about what I want to do:

This page will show a list of post published by the admin.

I think there is not too much to say about a Login interface.

*View posts as an admin*

When the admin has logged into the system, his view change a little bit, so he can edit/remove, and add posts.

5. Some informal EDT

Yes, is not an strict one, but I need a baseline in order to make the project.

Actually, it is possible that some points changes in the future. It depends from a few factors, like the time, tasks completed, etc.
